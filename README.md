# ABOUT THE PROJECT
The UNICEF State of the World's Children (SOCW) 2023 report has revealed concerning trends in child well-being and development across the globe. While progress has been made in various areas, there are persistent challenges that need urgent attention. As part of a collaborative effort with UNICEF, our task is to analyse the data provided in report to uncover key insights and highlight the top challenges faced by children.

Data from the 2021 UNICEF report and additional external metrics, which includes data on various indicators such as child mortality rates, access to education, healthcare services, nutrition, and protection from violence and
exploitation is provided for analysis.

Only Tableau Cloud services are at the disposal of students. The use of Python, R, or other BI tools is not allowed.

# AIMS OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to produce data insights that help UNICEF to highlight the challenges worldâ€™s children are having. Two following tasks should be fulfilled to meet the purpose of the project:
1. Visualise what life looks like for children under 5 years old in the world today. What is/are the biggest direct or indirect challenge(s) the children face today?
2. Choose and focus on the top challenge(s) and highlight the issues affecting it. Make a country level analysis of the challenge(s). Are these focused on certain areas of the world, specific a group of countries or are these a global phenomena?

# ABOUT OUR REPORT
We produced the report through the use of dashboards on Tableau. All the figures were also generated using Tableau. With the report, we aimed to fulfil all the project requirements by providing an overview of under-five mortality rate around the world, explaining possible reasons for the deaths, and giving some recommendations based on the insights.

## What does life look like for children under five in the world today?
- Continuous progess has led to **fewer children dying** before turning five years old.
- Under-five children endure **inequality in survival chances** depending on where they live, their socio-economic background, and whether they live in a fragile and conflict-affected seeting.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** bears the greatest burden of under-five deaths worldwide, followed by **Southern Asia**.
- More under-five deaths could have been prevented by effective yet often low-cost **necessary interventions**.
